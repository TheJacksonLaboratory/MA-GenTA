# Data Processing
----------

## Overview:

This section describes a pipeline to process sequencing data from the MA-GenTA assay. 

The pipeline begins with raw fastq files and results in per-sample read count tables.

The read count tables resulting from this pipeline can be used in the "Downstream Analysis" section.

Probe location BED files needed for data processing are located here.
